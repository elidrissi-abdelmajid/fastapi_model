# Iris Classification Model with FastAPI and Docker

This repository contains an Iris classification model deployed using **FastAPI** and **Docker**. The model is trained on the famous **Iris dataset** and is capable of classifying Iris flowers based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The model is served as an API that takes input data and returns the predicted class.

## Features

- **Iris Flower Classification**: The model classifies iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**.
- **FastAPI**: A fast and efficient web framework to serve the model.
- **Docker**: The app is containerized for easy deployment and scalability.

## Setup

Follow these steps to run the Iris classification model with FastAPI in a Docker container.

### 1. Clone the Repository
